<div class="section">
    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>I am a Polish immigrant, a dedicated professional, and someone who believes in fairness over division. I’ve spent my career in Learning & Development, specialising in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). My mission is to build a united and strong UK—one that values hard work, opportunity, and honesty.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Setting the Record Straight</h2>
    <p>Reform UK is often unfairly labeled. But let’s be clear: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If Reform UK were racist, would a Polish immigrant like me be a candidate?</li>
        <li>Accusations of racism are often used to silence fair debate.</li>
        <li>Wanting a fair and controlled immigration system is not racism—it’s common sense.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>What I Stand For</h2>
    <div class="key-points">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fairness, Not Favoritism</strong> – Everyone should have equal opportunities based on merit.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Borders, Smart Immigration</strong> – A system that supports hardworking people and protects public services.</li>
            <li><strong>Unity Over Division</strong> – We are stronger together, no matter our background.</li>
            <li><strong>Freedom of Speech</strong> – Open and honest discussions should be encouraged, not censored.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Real Divide</h2>
    <p>The real issue isn’t race or nationality—it’s fairness vs. manipulation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> People who want fairness vs. Politicians who divide us</li>
        <li>Hardworking citizens vs. Out-of-touch elites</li>
        <li>Real solutions vs. Media-driven smears</li>
    </ul>
</div>
